  <description summary="color management protocol">
    The aim of the color management extension is to allow clients to know
    the color properties of outputs, and to tell the compositor about the color
    properties of their content on surfaces. Doing this enables a compositor
    to perform automatic color management of content for different outputs
    according to how content is intended to look like.

    The color properties are represented as an image description object which
    is immutable after it has been created. A wl_output always has an
    associated image description that clients can observe. A wl_surface
    always has an associated preferred image description as a hint chosen by
    the compositor that clients can also observe. Clients can set an image
    description on a wl_surface to denote the color characteristics of the
    surface contents.

    An image description includes SDR and HDR colorimetry and encoding, HDR
    metadata, and viewing environment parameters. An image description does
    not include the properties set through color-representation extension.
    It is expected that the color-representation extension is used in
    conjunction with the color management extension when necessary,
    particularly with the YUV family of pixel formats.

    Recommendation ITU-T H.273
    "Coding-independent code points for video signal type identification"
    shall be referred to as simply H.273 here.

    The color-and-hdr repository
    (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pq/color-and-hdr) contains
    background information on the protocol design and legacy color management.
    It also contains a glossary, learning resources for digital color, tools,
    samples and more.

    The terminology used in this protocol is based on common color science and
    color encoding terminology where possible. The glossary in the color-and-hdr
    repository shall be the authority on the definition of terms in this
    protocol.

        The mastering display primaries define the target color volume.

        If mastering display primaries are not explicitly set, the target
        color volume is assumed to be equal to the primary color volume.

        The target color volume is defined by all tristimulus values between 0.0
        and 1.0 (inclusive) of the color space defined by the given mastering
        display primaries and white point. The colorimetry is identical between
        the container color space and the mastering display color space,
        including that no chromatic adaptation is applied even if the white
        points differ.

        The target color volume can exceed the primary color volume to allow for
        a greater color volume with an existing color space definition (for
        example scRGB). It can be smaller than the primary color volume to
        minimize gamut and tone mapping distances for big color spaces (HDR
        metadata).

        To make use of the entire target color volume a suitable pixel format
        has to be chosen (e.g. floating point to exceed the primary color

        If a client uses target color volume exceeding the primary color volume

        defined. Compositors are recommended to detect this case and fail the

      <description summary="indication that the object is ready to be used">
        Once this event has been sent, the mesa_image_description_v1 object is
        deemed "ready". Ready objects can be used to send requests and can be
        used through other interfaces.

        Every ready mesa_image_description_v1 protocol object refers to an
        underlying image description record in the compositor. Multiple protocol
        objects may end up referring to the same record. Clients may identify
        these "copies" by comparing their id numbers: if the numbers from two
        protocol objects are identical, the protocol objects refer to the same
        image description record. Two different image description records
        cannot have the same id number simultaneously. The id number does not
        change during the lifetime of the image description record.

        The id number is valid only as long as the protocol object is alive.
        If all protocol objects referring to the same image description record
        are destroyed, the id number may be recycled for a different image
        description record.

        Image description id number is not a protocol object id. Zero is
        reserved as an invalid id number. It shall not be possible for a
        client to refer to an image description by its id number in protocol.
        The id numbers might not be portable between Wayland connections.

        This identity allows clients to de-duplicate image description records
        and avoid get_information request if they already have the image
        description information.
