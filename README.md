This is a game streaming and remote desktop tool for Linux hosts, featuring:

 - **Headless multitenant rendering:** Streamed applications are run offscreen, isolated from the rest of the system and any display hardware.
 - **No system dependencies:** The server is a single static binary, and there's no dependency on docker, pipewire, or any other systemwide setup.
 - **Native linux containerization:** apps are isolated in rootless containers with the equivalent of unshare(1), using new Linux namespace features
 - **High quality, tunable, 4k streaming:** See the [list of supported codecs](https://colinmarc.github.io/magic-mirror/setup/server/#hardware-software-encoding). 10-bit HDR support is in progress.
 - **Very low latency:** No extra CPU-GPU copy when using hardware encode. Total latency is less than one frame.
 - **Local cursor rendering:** Use the client-side cursor for minimal input lag.
 - **Client support for macOS and Linux:** A [SwiftUI client](https://github.com/colinmarc/magic-mirror-swiftui/releases/latest) is available for macOS, with tvOS/iOS support coming soon.

> [!WARNING]
> Alpha software! Please submit any issues you encounter. Run the server with `--bug-report` to generate detailed logs and record videos to attach to your report.
